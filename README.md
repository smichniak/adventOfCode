# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges across multiple years, implemented in different programming languages as a way to explore various programming paradigms and language features.

## 🎄 Years and Languages

| Year | Language | Stars | 
|------|----------|-------|
| **2020** | Python | 28/50⭐ 
| **2021** | C++ | 38/50⭐ 
| **2022** | Haskell | 50/50⭐ 
| **2023** | Rust | 50/50⭐ 
| **2024** | Elixir | 29/50⭐ (in progress)

Each year's directory is self-contained with:
- Source code for daily solutions
- Input files for each day's puzzle
- Language-specific build configuration
- Detailed README with setup and usage instructions

## 🚀 Quick Start

Recent years have their own setup requirements and usage patterns. For detailed instructions see:

- **[AOC2022 (Haskell)](AOC2022/README.md)** - Cabal-based project with comprehensive CLI
- **[AOC2023 (Rust)](AOC2023/README.md)** - Cargo workspace with solution runner and boilerplate generator
- **[AOC2024 (Elixir)](AOC2024/README.md)** - Mix project with custom tasks for development workflow

## 🎯 About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual programming event that takes place in December, featuring daily programming puzzles of varying difficulty. Each day typically consists of two related problems that build upon each other, encouraging both algorithmic thinking and code evolution.


*Happy coding! 🎄✨*
